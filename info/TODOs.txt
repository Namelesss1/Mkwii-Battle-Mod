- Continue to fix code up to make it neater, as always. It can always be improved because I am noob yay.

-------BUGS & CHANGES NEEDED-------

- Strange softlock when swapping a character that makes you unable to move. Might be caused when the timer forces you to close out..

- Make the Lightning cup (Character Swap Cup) Unpickable by random. Maybe in Random.mod from Bean & Chadderz's code.

- Coin Runners only lasts for one battle before switching back to balloons in FFA mode. Perhaps store the gamemode to memory upon
  starting froom, and referring to that mem location to determine gamemode?

- After that, make sure to improve the fix to teammate pt count in FFA.

- Add support for 2-player modes in FFA.
