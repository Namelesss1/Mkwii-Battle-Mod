- Continue to fix code up to make it neater, as always. It can always be improved.

- Add code that causes WWs to randomly load custom gamemodes ("The next battle is Bob-omb blast! The next battle is FFA, No Mercy!, The
Next Battle is A Normal Balloon Battle!). These gamemodes should "sync" for each player (i.e. If its bob-omb blast, all players should
be in bob-omb blast mode.)

- WWs: Even number of players are team mode. Odd numbers are FFA.

- Add rotating triple bananas back in.

- Add the war-mode option in Riivolution. It will only contain the froom team ordering feature. And possibly any other feature that
  could help with competative events. 

-------BUGS & CHANGES NEEDED-------

- Strange softlock when swapping a character that makes you unable to move. Might be caused when the timer forces you to close out..

- Fix course vote names (They work in "VS" mode, perhaps something to do with track names into memory?)

- Look into & Fix any possible bug in choosing random online?

- Make the Lightning cup (Character Swap Cup) Unpickable by random. Maybe in Random.mod from Bean & Chadderz's code.

- Coin Runners only lasts for one battle before switching back to balloons in FFA mode. Perhaps store the gamemode to memory upon
  starting froom, and referring to that mem location to determine gamemode?

- After that, make sure to improve the fix to teammate pt count in FFA.

- Add support for 2-player modes in FFA.
