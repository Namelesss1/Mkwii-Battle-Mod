Credits regarding codes run by this project.


Davidevgen - Item Limiters [Used in bob-omb blast, fibbed modes]


MrBean35000vr - Change Characters Between WiFi Races Code 
I modified this code to work for battles - changing vehicles in-between battles. I also Use it to load
certain screens into memory that may not be present at times. Bean's code is EXTREMELY useful.
, also the CT-CODE engine this project runs on.


Chadderz - CT-Code engine.


Geeh - Hit your teammates in battle mode. I happened to accidentally stumble across how to do this on my own afterward,
but still deserves credit as I've used the code before I learned how to manipulate it on my own.


Zak (Vega) 
- Very useful tutorials on Assembly and Manipulating mkwii's code, main reason I've been able to do
any of these mods at all. Without his resources, none of this would have been accomplished by me (Or would take 200x as 
long)


- A memory address used in his "Equal Probability Code" is used in the Bob-omb blast & fibs mode. (It happens to be the address
that reads from ItemSlot.bin and stores each probability!)


- His "Stacked Teams" battle/Team VS code is used & slightly modified in this project to make froom teams predictable:
Teams are now based on the order in which players join a froom! 


Volderbeek (Online VS course vote check)


Star (Exception Recovery code)
