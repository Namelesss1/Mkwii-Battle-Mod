These files are placed within /bad1/mod/ folder in Bean's CT-code engine.

#NOTE: 
These are not the only files used in the project. The following files created by
Bean and Chadderz are used as well:

* mod2.mod
* menu.mod (I modified this one?)
* random.mod
* track_redirect.mod (I modified this one as well I believe?)
* filter.mod
* bmg.mod

Also, there is an additional mod that contains Star's exception recovery code in it,
which is not uploaded here since its not my work anyway. It can be found at https://mkwii.com/archive/index.php?thread-1164.html
