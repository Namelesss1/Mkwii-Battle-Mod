These files are placed within /bad1/mod/ folder in Bean's CT-code engine.

# NOTE: 
These are not the only files used in the project. The following files created by
Bean and Chadderz are used as well:

mod2.mod
menu.mod
random.mod
track_redirect.mod
filter.mod
bmg.mod

Also, there is an additional mod that contains Star's exception recovery code in it,
which is not uploaded here since its not my work anyway. It can be found at https://mkwii.com/archive/index.php?thread-1164.html
